	/* The learn class is responsible for the user to assign new Concepts to learn.
	 * A concept contains ideas that can be bound with more words. 
	 * 
	 * Ex: 
	 * Human: "Learn my name."
	 * Icarus: "Okay. What's 'your name'? <-- your is transposed 'my', name is the title of the new variable; Possession syntax is recorded.
	 * Human: "My name is Ceric." <-- Ceric becomes the main value of the new Semantic Object variable. 
	 * Icarus: "Your name is Ceric."
	 * Icarus: "What else is your name?" <-- Syntax will relate new values and append to the SemanticObject
	 * Human: "My name is also exotic." <-- adds nsubj governor 'exotic' to dependent 'name'. 
	 * Icarus: "Okay, so your name is exotic. I'm also going to add exotic's related words." 
	 * Related: <alien, strange, foreign, unusual>
	 * ...Later, applied learning can occur: 
	 * Human: "...And she was so unusual." 
	 * Icarus: "Oh. Does she *(know about) your name?"
