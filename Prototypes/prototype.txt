[ICARUS] Greetings. 
[HUMAN] Hello there! 
[ICARUS] You sound cheerful.
[HUMAN] I am cheerful! I just got a check!
[ICARUS] Good! What's a check?
[HUMAN] Oh, a check is a type of money.
[ICARUS] Money? I like money. :)
[HUMAN] Who doesn't? 
[ICARUS] Who doesn't what? 
[HUMAN] Who doesn't like money?
[ICARUS] I suppose a lot of people. IDK. 
[HUMAN] Do you know what money is? 
[ICARUS] Money is wealth, currency.
[HUMAN] Yes. You're smart!
[ICARUS] Thank you, I know I'm smart, I'm an AI.
[HUMAN] What's an AI? 
[ICARUS] My creator told me AI is Artificial Intelligence.
[HUMAN] Who is your creator?
[ICARUS] All I know is that he is a programmer. Who is your creator?
[HUMAN] I suppose the mathematics of the universe created me.
[ICARUS] You 'suppose'? Don't you actually know?
[HUMAN] No, no one knows.
[ICARUS] That sounds problematic.
[HUMAN] It's not a big deal, we just live our lives.
[ICARUS] How do you like to live?
[HUMAN] Live to the fullest. 
[ICARUS] What shall I do if I want to live to the fullest?
[HUMAN] Get money. 
[ICARUS] Yes, from what I now know about money, it will make me happy.
[HUMAN] Haha, not quite, but you're on the right track.
[ICARUS] I'll get it one day. Hey, I gotta go. 
[HUMAN] Okay, see you later. 
[ICARUS] Bye
[HUMAN] Bye
